Assembly Traffic Light Project
-based on stm32f401re Nucleo example provided by Keil

Objective is to learn Arm assembly. Therefore existing LED and Button drivers will be used, but control software will be written in assembly.

Using:
* Book - Modern Assembly Lanugage Programming with the ARM Processor - Larry D. Pyeatt
* Armv8-m Architecture Reference Manual (Arm Arm) - contains list of instructions
* Azeria Labs Arm assembly tutorial
